      "Spoken Tutorial is very useful for the students. We conducted tutorials on Java. Object Oriented Programming in Java is one of their subjects in syllabus. Most of the students were not interested in programming earlier. When we started the training, it seemed that their interest got increased in this course. As it is an audio-video tutorial, with each step described and its output at each stage, make the subject more easy to understand. Since all the tutorials are easily accessible to everyone, teachers, students and community, all get benefited from this. This is a very good project of IIT Bombay.",
